# License-Plate-Recognition-System
This was my 3rd Year's Mini Project.
the code in "final.py" file is the main python code with gui part included.
I have used Py-tesseract and Tkinter in this code.

The image files in this repository are the trial images which were used as inputs in the project.
After you run the code an result file (result.jpg) will be generated in the same directory where the main code is present.
